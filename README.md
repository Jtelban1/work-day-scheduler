# work-day-scheduler-

I created the basic layout with bootstrap while also creating my class of rows and columns to create the appriopriate text areas. I used moment.js to run the current date and time on my page.

I created the saved buttons with an onClick function which then saved my values to the local storage. 

I next created a function with an (if,else) statement to allow the time-blocks to change colors based on the time of day it was. I used jquery for this.
